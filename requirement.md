### ðŸ“‚ General Functionality

- The board should consist of **four columns**:
    - Not Started
    - In Progress
    - Blocked
    - Done
- Each column should contain cards representing tasks.
- Each card should be:
    - Draggable between columns (Drag & Drop support).
    - Display the task title and optionally a due date or sub-tasks (if applicable).
- Tasks should persist across reloads

### âœ¨ Bonus Points

Not required, but you'll earn extra credit if you:

- Support creating new tasks and editing/deleting existing ones.
- Add support for subtasks (as seen in the "Taxes" card).
- Show due dates with different background colors depending on urgency.
- Add animations during drag or state changes.

This mini-project is meant to test your abilities to build a complex components. You will be judged on the following:

1. Libraries used (besides react, react is compulsory to use)
2. Quality of UI â€” animations, transitions, how polished it is
3. Quality of code â€” cleanliness maintained, how modular it is
